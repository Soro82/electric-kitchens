They can choose the date and time for their lesson, whether they would like it indoor or outdoor, their level of experience and what horse they would like for their lesson. They also have the option to indicate if they are an adult or a child and to enter their height if they wish.

## Agile Methodology
* Agile Methodology was used for this project as it required a lot of planning.
* The Kanban Board was created using GitHub. The link to the board is [here](https://github.com/users/Soro82/projects/3).
* I used six milestones for the project, one for each Epic. 
* The milestones helped to track my progress through the project. 
* The User Stories were divided into three categories - must have, should have and could have. 
* I used labels to categorize the user stories.
* I changed the "Approve Reviews" user story from "should have" to "won't have" as it was not required to complete the project.
